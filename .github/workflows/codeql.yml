# You may wish to alter this file to override the set of languages analyzed,
# or to provide custom queries or build logic.

# ```{note}
# We have attempted to detect the languages in your repository. Please check
# the `language` matrix defined below to confirm you have the correct set of
# supported CodeQL languages.
